            <h3><a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble.com</a> (CRAPs Well)</h3>
            <p class="site-description">
                Dribble is an online platform for finding and hiring designers
                as well as for designers to showcase their work and get hired.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast</b>
                    <p>The site shows good contrast in using black and pink colors
                        over a white background and grey input elements.
                        Additionally, good spacing is established using a grid
                        layout with sufficient guttering.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Repetition</b>
                    <p>The site has a consistent color and design theme with black and pink
                        overlaying a grey background. The site also observes a consistent set
                        of fonts and shapes with rounded edges.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Alignment</b>
                    <p>The site uses a clean grid layout to showcase various featured designers
                        to potential customers as well as incorporates a fixed navigation bar which
                        stays fixed at the top as the user scrolls. Partitioning is also used for organization
                        and emphasis.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Proximity</b>
                    <p>The site groups featured designs together in a grid,
                        as well as groups related articles from the blog in a column. In this way, navigation
                        is very intuitive.

            <h3><a href="http://www.johnnyburrito.com/">Johnny Burrito</a> (CRAPs Poorly)</h3>
            <p class="site-description">
                Johnny Burrito is a restaurant specializing in burritos in
                Central Charlotte.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast</b>
                    <p>The site uses a lot of bright font and background colors for text throughout the site.
                        The site also features a variety of emphaszied elements meant to
                        catch the attention of the user. However, it comes off as cluttered.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Repetition</b>
                    <p>The site offers very little repetition and seems to just have content
                        listed with no real methodology as to why. The site does, however, seem to
                        stick to a red-green-blue color scheme over yellow with red buttons which is
                        at least somewhat coherent.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Alignment</b>
                    <p>The site lists content in a somewhat organized manner, but the organization
                        is not consistent and varies widely by page and content. This is disorienting,
                        but alos makes the page unique.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><b>Proximity</b>
                    <p>The site, despite seeming to list random stuff, does observe some proximity in its listing of
                        content.
                        However, due to the interspersing of random stuff, it's hard to focus on and process just one
                        section of information.
